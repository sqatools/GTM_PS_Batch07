What is framework:

A testing framework is a set of guidelines and rules used for creating the design of test cases or test
scenarios, A framework combination of practices and tools that are designed to help QA Professional to
test the application more efficiently.

# Benefits of Automation Framework

->  Improve test efficiency
->  Lower maintenance cost of test cases.
->  Minimum manual intervention
->  Maximum test coverage of any application
->  Re-usability of code.
->  Faster debugging of failure
->  Quick report generation

# Types of Automation Framework

-> Linear Automation Framework:
    -> When record the automation test cases and execute it, its called linear framework
    -> When we create individual script for each task maintain separately.


-> Modular Based Testing Framework:
   ->  In Module framework we divide the test cases in multiple units or function and section, each
       of the section is isolated.

-> Library Based Testing Framework:
   ->  In library framework we can design the specific library that we can use in all modules
       we have created in moduler framework. e.g. selenium code library, file handling library.

-> Data-Driven Framework:
   -> When we read the test data from external file and use in automation framework, thn it is called
      data driven framework. e.g. read data from excel file or json file, or database.

-> Keyword Driven Framework:
   ->  In keyword driven framework, ready to use keyword are available to perform any
       specific task.
   ->  User can use the predefined n number and times to complete task
   e.g. Robotframework

-> Hybrid Framework:
   ->  Hybrid framework is combination of all above framework that we discussed.
   ->  User will use all the properties of different framework and to create highly efficient
       and re-usable framework.

# Pytest : Pytest is Python Library through which we can create test file, test function.
           ->  grouping of test case.
           ->  Marking test cases
           ->  Parallel execution
           ->  Add logging in the framework
           ->  Generate report for the framework
           ->  Create configuration files for framework
           ->  Parameterize the test cases
           ->  User can exclude or include test cases as per their required during the execution.



POM (Page Object Model) : POM is design pattern of the class structure of the Automation Framework
                 -> In POM user will create class for each page of the application
                 -> User can create the object of the page class whenever required.
